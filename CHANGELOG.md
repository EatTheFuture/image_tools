## [Unreleased]

### New tools.

- Working on a camera analysis tool that will (among other things) estimate the transfer function of cameras and export them as LUTs.  This is useful when you want to linearize footage from a camera without a published transfer function LUT, which is often the case for e.g. cheaper cameras and phones.
