# ETF Image Tools

Eat the Future's collection of tools for working with captured images and colors in a VFX pipeline.

Currently there are three tools: ETF HDRI Merge, ETF LUT Maker, and ETF OCIO Maker.

**This software is currently alpha quality.**  There is enough there to be useful, but don't expect a polished experience.  We also aren't able to test on all platforms, so you may run into issues depending on your hardware and OS.  Bug reports are very appreciated!


## ETF HDRI Merge

A tool for merging a series of low-dynamic-range images at different exposures into a single high-dynamic-range image.

At the moment this only works correctly with image files that contain Exif data about their exposures.  Typically these will be JPEGs, although several standard image formats are supported.  The resulting HDRIs are always saved in .hdr format.

### To-do:

- [ ] Let users select a filmic "look" when previewing the HDRI (currently it just maps straight to sRGB, which isn't great).
- [ ] Let users load custom transfer function LUTs (e.g. from ETF LUT Maker) to linearize input images.  Currently linearization is always estimated.
- [ ] Let users specify color gamut conversions.
- [ ] Support camera raw images as input, with demosaicing support.
- [ ] Support saving to EXR files.


## ETF LUT Maker

A tool for generating and adjusting LUTs.

Currently this is only capable of generating 1D transfer function LUTs.

### To-do:

- [x] Allow loading LUTs to be used as the basis for generating a new LUT (useful for e.g. correcting the black levels of a manufacturer-provided LUT).
- [x] Allow loading of 16-bit TIFF and PNG files, for estimating parameters of high bit-depth footage.
- [ ] Export transfer function LUTs with a bit of buffer outside the normal range of the LUT (useful for e.g. preserving negative values throughout a pipeline).
- [ ] Generate 3D LUTs for chroma, based on color checker images.
- [ ] Generate 3D LUTs for chroma, based on camera sensor spectral sensitivity data.


## ETF OCIO Maker

A tool to easily generate custom Open Color IO configurations.

### To-do:

- [x] Save data in the OCIO config file that allows OCIO Maker to re-open the config for further editing.  Right now, after closing OCIO Maker you have to start all over if you want to change something, which can be obnoxious.
- [x] Allow specifying custom chromaticity coordinates (currently limited to presets in a menu).
- [x] Allow specifying a base template config, along with custom reference/working color space.
- [x] Do reasonable gamut clipping on output transforms.
- [x] Do reasonable gamut clipping on input transforms.
- [ ] Add a template for ACES "lite".  Essentially, the same as ACES except without the massive list of IDTs (since you'll be adding your own IDTs).
  - [x] "ACES Lite" template added, but not yet complete.
- [ ] User-adjustable tone mappers (currently WIP).
- [ ] Support for 3D LUTs.
