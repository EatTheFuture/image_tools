/// Various methods for mapping and clipping out-of-gamut RGB colors.
///
/// All functions in this module take the rgb color to be clipped and an
/// optional `channel_max` as the first two parameters.
///
/// If `channel_max` is `None`, then the gamut is assumed to extend to
/// infinite luminance, and colors will not be clipped on that axis.
/// This is typically useful for processing input colors (e.g. footage,
/// textures).  If `channel_max` is `Some(value)`, then `value` is
/// the maximum value each RGB channel can be in the output, and colors
/// will be clipped to that as well.  This is typically useful for
/// processing output colors (e.g. for display).
use colorbox::transforms::rgb_gamut;

/// A simple but reasonably robust approach that clips in RGB space.
///
/// - `luminance_weights`: the relative amount that each RGB channel
///   contributes to luminance.  The three weights should add up to
///   1.0.
/// - `softness`: if there is a `channel_max`, this is the amount of
///   "cheating" to do to make the transition blowing out to white
///   smooth and pleasing.  0.0 is no cheating, but results in a
///   possibly over-sharp transition.  Larger values cheat more to
///   make the transition smoother.  Good values are generally
///   between 0.05 and 0.2.
